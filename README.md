The vehicle length, ground clearance and vehicle weight variables all have low p-values indicating the effect is large or that the result is of major theoretical, clinical or practical importance. The slope of our model is not 0 indicating sufficient evidence to reject our null hypothesis. The p-value of our linear regression analysis is 5.35e-11, which is much smaller than our assumed significance level. The multiple linear regression model does a good job of predicting MPG for MechaCar because of its low overall p-value of 5.35e-11. this is much lower than the standard 5% and gives us extreme confidence.

The average variance for all lots is roughly 62 pounds per square inch. Lot1 is respectively 0.9, lot2 7.5, and lot3 is 170. Lot3 is the only category that exceeds threshold limit of 100 and is main contributor to over lot variance of 62.
